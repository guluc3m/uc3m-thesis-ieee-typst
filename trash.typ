#strong[Part 1: Reflection on ethical and responsible behaviour]

Please be aware that the use of Generative AI carries some risks and may
generate a series of consequences that affect the moral integrity of your
performance with it. Therefore, we ask you to answer the following questions
honestly (#emph[please tick all that apply];):

If you #strong[did NOT] have the permission of those concerned in any of
questions 1, 2 or 3, briefly explain why #emph[(e.g. \"the materials were
  protected but permitted use for this purpose\" or \"the terms of use, which
  can be found at this address (...), prevent the use I have made, but it was
  essential given the nature of the work\".]

#strong[Part 2: Declaration of technical use]

Use the following model statement as many times as necessary, in order to
reflect all types of iteration you have had with Generative AI tools. Include
one example for each type of use where indicated: #emph[\[Add an example\].]

#strong[I declare that I have made use of the Generative AI system (];Name of AI
system/tool and version: ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot...) #strong[for:]

#emph[#strong[Documentation and drafting:];]

- #emph[Supporting reflection in relation to the development of the work:
    iterative process of analysing alternatives and approaches using AI]

#emph[\[Add an example\] For example: I have asked for a list of alternatives to
  address the problem stated at the beginning of the paper.]

- #emph[Revision or rewriting of previously drafted paragraphs]

#emph[\[Add an example\] For example: I have asked for paragraphs to be
  rewritten to shorten the conclusions while keeping the same ideas already
  written.]

- #emph[Search for information or answers to specific questions]

#emph[\[Add an example\] For example: The questions asked were aimed at
  \[finding definitions, explanations of processes, examples of use, lists of
  risks of use...\].]

- #emph[Bibliography search]

- #emph[Summary of bibliography consulted]

- #emph[Translation of texts consulted]

#emph[#strong[Develop specific content];]

#emph[Generative AI has been used as a support tool for the development of the
  specific content of the dissertation, including:]

- #emph[Assistance in the development of lines of code (programming)]

#emph[\[Add an example of the usual flow of use for programming\] For example: I
  have asked for explanations about a code in Python.]

- #emph[Generation of diagrams, images, audios or videos]

#emph[\[indicate its use in this section, as well as in a footnote to the
  figure/element generated by Generative AI\] For example: Source: own
  elaboration with the help of Midjourney.]

- #emph[Optimisation processes]

#emph[\[Add an example of the usual flow of use to optimise\] For example: I
  have asked for help to correct and explain errors in a code that was not
  working properly.]

- #emph[Data processing: collection, analysis, cross-checking of data...]

#emph[\[Add an example\] For example: after collecting the data, I have asked
  for guidance in normalising the data in preparation for the subsequent
  analysis.]

- #emph[Inspiration of ideas in the creative process]

#emph[\[Add an example\] For example: once I was clear about the objective of
  the work, I asked for ideas to cover the project from a multidisciplinary
  approach.]

- #emph[Other uses linked to the generation of specific points of the specific
    development of the work]

If you think it is necessary to include it, add it in each case:

#strong[using the #emph[prompt ];];#emph[.#strong[..];]

#emph[(write the request made to the IAG)]

#strong[having as interaction ...]

#emph[(describe what interaction you made with the IAG after the prompt\'s
  response)]

Example: #emph[#strong[I declare that] I have made use of the Generative AI
  system #strong[Chat GPT 3.5] to #strong[search for information] using
  #strong[the prompt:] \"#strong[Tell me a concrete example that illustrates the
    application of the urban planning proposal of the 15-minute City in
    Spain\"];, having as interaction #strong[the proposition of the concrete
    example of the Chamart√≠n district that has been reflected in the report];.]

#strong[Part 3: Reflection on utility]

Please provide a personal assessment (free format) of the strengths and weaknesses you have identified in the use of Generative AI tools in the development of your work. Mention if it has helped you in the learning process, or in the development or drawing conclusions from your work.
